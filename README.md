### Set this project locally :computer:

1. Go to the [project repo](https://github.com/hamhaingaurav/devresources) and fork it by clicking "Fork" ( or Download the Zip file directly and start from the step 3 )<br>

2. Open terminal / command prompt and Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devresources.git`
  
3. Create a python3 virtual environment:

    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    Or, use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html):

    ```bash
    $ virtualenv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    On Linux or Mac or any Unix based system-
    
    ```bash
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
    On Windows-
    ```
    > venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

5. Now Install the dependecies:

    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Creating local settings:
Create a `local_settings.py` file in the same directory where your `settings.py` resides.

    Copy this code in your `local_settings.py` file -
    ```
    DEBUG = True
    ```
    
7. Creating `.env` file:
Create a `.env` file in the same directory where your `manage.py` resides.

    Copy this text in your `.env` file -
    ```
    SECRET_KEY = 'secretkey'
    ```

8. Run the `migrate` command:

    ```bash
    $ python manage.py migrate
    ```

9. Now you are ready to go:

    #### Run the application

    ```bash
    $ python manage.py runserver
    ```

10. Optionally you can also add some dump data into your local database  using this command:
    
    #### Add redacted dump data

    ***Note***: Please run these commands in the same order it has been written here, either it will cause integrity error in your database.

    ```bash
    $ python manage.py loaddata fixtures/ResourceCategory.json
    
    $ python manage.py loaddata fixtures/Resource.json
    ```
